Your response goes here!

new skills that I have learned involved using a new text editor that I have not previously used, brackets. 

Most of the html used in this project was fairly simply and straight forward and did not really involve having to looking anything up. 

Difficult aspect of this project would be using a text editor I have not previously used. 

Problem solving strategies for this project involved separating the big blocks of text from top to bottom so that I can read the document easily.
